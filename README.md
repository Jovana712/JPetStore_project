JPetStore_project 

  I approached the software testing process the application JPetStor–µ (url address = https://petstore.octoperf.com/), 
in response to the task of the "IT Bootcamp" school, where I started learning manual and automatic software testing.

  This testing done using Java programming language, testing frameworks: Selenium WebDriver, TestNG and Page Object Model (POM)
and development environment - Eclipse IDE. Also, Excel files were readed by used Appache POI libraries.
